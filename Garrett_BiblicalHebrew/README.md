# Verb Paraidgms:
(a simple way to reproduce the verbal paradigms)
1. [Qal Qatal Strong Verb Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9xVYJ-sJ2k)
2. [Qal Qatal III-Hey Verb Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIEL2xp1ogo)
3. [Qal Yiqtol Strong Verb Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cuka5tgK94)
4. [Qal Yiqtol III-Hey Verb Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ewIlzYvoB4)

The Wayyiqtol paradigms may be memorized in comparison to the Yiqtol paradigms.
1. You add Waw, Pathach, and dagesh forte in the beginning.
2. But, Aleph (only Qal Wayyiqtol 1cs) rejects the dagesh forte and causes lengthening of Pathach to Qamets.
3. Also, be aware of the apocopated forms of בנה (only 3ms, 3fs, and 2ms), which also results in vowel change and accent shift.
