    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>❗❗❗ In the vocabulary matching questions, each option can be correctly matched with ONLY one word. If you
        choose
        the same option
        for two words in the vocabulary matching questions, you are assured that at least one of them will be marked as
        incorrect.❗❗❗</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Others</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The inseparable prepositions could cause problems as sometimes it may be difficult to recognize whether the
        definite article is present or not. However, if you are familiar with the rule of shewa, then it wouldn’t be too
        difficult.</li>
      <li>For a noun with a inseparable preposition, with what spellings is there NOT an article on the noun? — No
        article if the vowel under the preposition is Shewa, or can be explained by the Rule of Shewa.</li>
      <li>For a noun with a inseparable preposition, with what spellings can you be sure that there IS an article on the
        noun? — Article if vowel under the preposition is not Shewa AND cannot be explained by the Rule of Shewa.</li>
      <li>What is the rule of shewa:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>When there would be two reduced vowels in a row, it changes the first reduced vowel into the corresponding
          short vowel (this is a general rule).</li>
      </ul>
