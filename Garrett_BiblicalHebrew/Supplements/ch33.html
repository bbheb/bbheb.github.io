  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Just like the Piel and Pual stems, the Hiphal and Hophal are closely related and similar in form.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The latter is the passive of the former.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In workbook assignments and exams, you only need to indicate it is a participle, except when we deal with the Qal participle, for which you need to specify whether it is an active or a passive participle.</li>
    <li>Beware that the stem vowel for the Hiphil Qatal 3rd person is Hireq Yod, while the stem vowel for the Hiphil Qatal 1st & 2nd person is Pathach.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This could be easily neglected.</li>
      <li>In the 1st and 2nd person, Lamed always takes a silent shewa.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Also, except for Hiphil Qatal, all the rest of the conjugations such as the Yiqtol, the imperative, the infinitive, and the participle, the vowel under the performative is almost always pathach (I–Nun and I–Yod verbs are exceptions, see Table 33.8, page 255).</li>
  </ul>
An interesting phenomenon:
<ul>
  <li>A verb with a I-נ and III-<span class="heb" dir="rtl">ה</span> has a very interesting phenomenon in both the Qal and Hiphil stems due to assimilation of the I-<span class="heb" dir="rtl">נ</span> and the apocopation of the III-<span class="heb" dir="rtl">ה</span>.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The Qal Wayyiqtol 3ms of <span class="heb" dir="rtl">נטה</span> is <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיֵּט</span>, and the Hiphil Wayyiqtol 3ms of <span class="heb" dir="rtl">נכה</span> is <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיַּךְ</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Take <span class="heb" dir="rtl">נטה</span>, to stretch out, to pitch (tent), for example.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>First, the I-<span class="heb" dir="rtl">נ</span> will assimilate: <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּנְטֶה</span> becomes <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּטֶּה</span> (cf. A.(2) on page 144 of the textbook.) </li>
    <li>Second, the III-<span class="heb" dir="rtl">ה</span> drops out (apocopation): <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּטֶּה</span> becomes וַיִּטּ. </li>
    <li>Third, when a final consonant has a dagesh forte but does not have any vowel, the dagesh forte is not willing to stay. It drops out. Therefore, <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּטּ</span> becomes <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּט</span>. </li>
    <li>Finally, now, the accent falls on the final syllable, causing the short vowel to be lengthened (Hireq to Tsere): <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיִּט</span> becomes <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיֵּט</span> (a closed, accented syllabus prefers [though not necessarily requires] a long vowel).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This is what we see in Gen 12: 8a, which says <cite>“He (Abram) moved from there to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיֵּט אָהֳלֹה</span>).”</cite></li>
  <ul>
    <li> (Advanced information: You have learned that <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וֹ</span> and <span class="heb" dir="rtl">הוּ</span> are alternative forms for the 3ms suffix [Table 14.1 on p. 89 of the textbook]. Well, the Holem Hey in <span class="heb" dir="rtl">אָהֳלֹה</span> is yet another alternative form for the 3ms suffix.)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In this case, only the <span class="heb" dir="rtl">ט</span> in <span class="heb" dir="rtl">נטה</span> is left, and the Tsere tells us that it is a Qal Wayyiqtol form.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The verb <span class="heb" dir="rtl">נכה</span> goes through a very similar process, resulting in <span class="heb" dir="rtl">וַיַּךְ</span>. The only differences are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The vowel under the preformative Yod is Pathach, an indication that it is a hiphil verb;</li>
    <li>The Pathach does not lengthen (remember that  a closed, accented syllabus <i>prefers</i>, but not necessarily <i>requires</i>, a long vowel).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>We see both verbs in Exod 8:17 [MT 8:13]:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> <span class="heb" dir="rtl"> ‏  וַיַּֽעֲשׂוּ־כֵ֗ן וַיֵּט֩ אַהֲרֹ֨ן אֶת־יָד֤וֹ בְמַטֵּ֙הוּ֙ וַיַּךְ֙ אֶת־עֲפַ֣ר הָאָ֔רֶץ וַתְּהִי֙ הַכִּנָּ֔ם בָּאָדָ֖ם וּבַבְּהֵמָ֑ה כָּל־עֲפַ֥ר הָאָ֛רֶץ הָיָ֥ה כִנִּ֖ים בְּכָל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃</span></li>
    <li><cite>[Exod 8:17 And they did so. Aaron stretched out (וַיֵּט) his hand with his staff and struck (וַיַּךְ) the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.]</cite></li>
  </ul>
