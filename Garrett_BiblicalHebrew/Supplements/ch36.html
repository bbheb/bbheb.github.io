	<h1> Ch. 36 Supplements </h1>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Beginning with Quiz 36, the quizzes will consist of only the vocabulary and sentence translations.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be no parsing questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Chapter 36 talks about cantillation marks and other Masoretic conventions.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>These are the works of the Masoretic but probably reflect a much earlier tradition.</li>
      <li>The cantillation marks are everywhere in the Hebrew Bible.</li>
      <li>Almost all grammar books use the “<span class="heb" dir="rtl">◌֫</span>” sign to mark the stress syllable of a Hebrew verb.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Hebrew Bible, however, this sign does not exist.</li>
        <li>Instead, the cantillation marks mark the accented syllable (though some are prepositive or postpositive).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When we approach the Hebrew Bible as a student and an exegete, the most valuable functions of the cantillation marks are:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>They enable us to know where the stress falls in most cases (not only for reading but also for distinguishing forms);</li>
        <li>They help us group words together and divide a clause into different parts.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Try to memorize the disjunctive cantillation marks on page 275.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>With these signs, you can divide a clause into a few word groups, as demonstrated on page 274.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Knowing this trick will help you tremendously in reading and translation.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
