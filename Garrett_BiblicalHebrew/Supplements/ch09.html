	<h1> Ch. 9 Supplements </h1>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Qal Qatal paradigms of <span class="heb" dir="rtl">קטל</span> and <span class="heb" dir="rtl">בּנה</span> must be memorized. You should be able to reproduce the paradigms in their entirety.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Steps to put the paradigms into long memory:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Study the paradigm visually, noticing the patterns</li>
      <li>Practice saying the paradigm out loud with the video lecture while looking at the paradigm until you can say it fluently aloud from memory with or without the English meaning.</li>
      <li>Practice with the paradigm sheet:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Write the paradigm without looking at the answer.</li>
        <li>Check your work after each form, correcting any mistakes.</li>
        <li>Study the forms you got wrong, and then try again</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When you write the entire paradigm correctly once, you’re done with the paradigm for that day.</li>
      <li>Every day, write the paradigm over and over until you get it entirely correct once.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The first day will take a long time, but after a few days, you should be getting it by the second try.</li>
        <li>When you get the paradigm correct the first time several days in a row, switch to every other day, then to twice a week, etc., until it is in long-term memory.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Be sure that you can write any requested form without writing out the whole paradigm.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>You may download the <a href="https://github.com/martinmts/BiblicalHebrew/blob/main/Garrett_BiblicalHebrew/Downloads/09_Qal%20Qatal%20Strong%20and%20III-Hey%20verb%20Paradigms.pdf">Qal Qatal Strong and III-Hey verb Paradigms Practice Sheet</a> for practice.</li>
