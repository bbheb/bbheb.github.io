<h3>Parsing the Participles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the Qal has both active and passive participles. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>In parsing, you need to indicate whether it is an active or a passive participle.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The Niphal stem has a passive or reflective meaning.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The meaning is conveyed by the Niphal stem itself. </li>
      <li>A Niphal passive participle does not exist. In parsing, you only need to say it is a Niphal participle.  </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Similarly, Pual is the passive of Piel. A Pual participle is passive in meaning, which is conveyed by the Pual stem itself.</li>
  </ul>
