	<h1> Ch. 2 Supplements </h1>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You must also be able to reproduce Table 2.1.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Others</h2>
<ul>
  <li>About the transliterations:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The transliterations are not tested in this class. However, many commentaries and other publications use transliterations. It is still very useful to know them.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>About Shewa</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We learned that a shewa under the first letter of a word is a vocal shewa. But there are exceptions!</li>
    <li>In <span class="heb" dir="rtl">שְׁתַּ֫יִם</span>,"two" (ch. 4), The shewa under Shin appears to be a silent shewa. Otherwise, the dagesh lene in Taw has to go.</li>
    <li>Do NOT stress on the exceptions! Just be aware of them!</li>
