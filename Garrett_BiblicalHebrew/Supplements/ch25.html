  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Finite verbs can take pronominal suffixes. They serve as the direct object or indirect object of the verb. </li>
    <li>Reproducing the verbal forms with pronominal suffixes is not required.</li>
    <li>The suffixes are not so difficult to recognize.</li>
    <li>However, when a suffix is added, one or two syllables are added at the end of the verb.</li>
    <li>As we have learned, the primary accent of a Hebrew word can only be either on the last or the next to the last syllable.</li>
    <li>Consequently, we will almost always have accent shifts and vowel changes.</li>
    <li>This brings us back to chapter 4.</li>
    <li>You must be familiar with the vowel change rules (pp. 24â€“26 of the textbook) in order to understand and parse the verbs.</li>
  </ul>
