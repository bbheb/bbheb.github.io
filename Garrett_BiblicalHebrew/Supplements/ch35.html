    <ul>
      <li>The stems addressed in chapter 35 are essentially different ways of doubling.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>As you will see, the alternative forms apply to the bi-consonantal verbs and the geminates.</li>
        <li>The 2nd root consonant is missing in the bi-consonantal verbs, there has to be an alternative way of
          doubling that is equivalent to the doubling in the 2nd root consonant in the regular three-consonant root
          verbs.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The geminates are trouble makers in all stems! </li>
      <li>The best way is to be aware of these alternative stems mentioned in this chapter and have the vocabulary
        memorized by heart.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For instance, when you see <span class="heb" dir="rtl">כּוֹנֵן</span>, at first you may be thinking that it
          is
          a Qal active participle MS verb from <span class="heb" dir="rtl">כּנן</span>. </li>
        <li>However, you have never learned a verb like <span class="heb" dir="rtl">כּנן</span> (In fact, this verb does
          not exist in the Hebrew Bible). </li>
        <li>Instead, if you are familiar with the vocabulary, you may quickly realize that you’ve learned the verb <span
            class="heb" dir="rtl">כּוּן</span>.</li>
        <li>When you bring the meaning of the verb into the sentence, it makes perfect sense.</li>
        <li>Then you can be pretty much sure that it is the verb <span class="heb" dir="rtl">כּוּן</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
