  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The stems addressed in chapter 35 are essentially different ways of doubling.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>As you will see, the alternative forms apply to the bi-consonantal verbs and the geminates.</li>
      <li>The 2nd root consonant is missing in the bi-consonantal verbs, there has to be an alternative way of doubling that is equivalent to the doubling in the 2nd root consonant in the regular three-consonant root verbs.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The geminates are trouble makers in all stems! </li>
    <li>The best way is to be aware of these alternative stems mentioned in this chapter and have the vocabulary memorized by heart.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, when you see כּוֹנֵן, at first you may be thinking that it is a Qal active participle MS verb from כּנן. </li>
      <li>However, you have never learned a verb like כּנן (In fact, this verb does not exist in the Hebrew Bible). </li>
      <li>Instead, if you are familiar with the vocabulary, you may quickly realize that you’ve learned the verb כּוּן.</li>
      <li>When you bring the meaning of the verb into the sentence, it makes perfect sense.</li>
      <li>Then you can be pretty much sure that it is the verb כּוּן.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
