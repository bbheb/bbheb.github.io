	<h1> Ch. 39 Supplements </h1>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These two chapters offers more information on historical discourse and paragraphs, connectors, and subordination as well as anticipatory and descriptive discourse.</li>
    <li>Discourse analysis helps us divide a text into blocks of paragraphs, for instance, mainline, offline, embedded speech.</li>
    <li>The conjunctions and particles also signify how clauses are connected.</li>
    <li>Anticipatory discourse normally appears in prophetic speeches. Descriptive discourse in historical narratives normally provides offline information, in embedded speeches is often a declaration of the speaker.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="heb" dir="rtl">תִּשְׁמְר֖וּ וַעֲשִׂיתֶֽם</span> in Ezek 36:27 (see the reading passage for the chapter) is usually translated as "you shall be careful to do . . ."</li>
  </ul>
