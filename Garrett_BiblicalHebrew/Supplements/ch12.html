  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When asked to reproduce paradigms, do not forget any consonants, vowels, shewas, dageshes. But do NOT put in accents and methegs.</li>
    <li>In translation questions: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The default tense for participles is present tense unless the context suggests otherwise.</li>
      <li>The default tense for Weqatal is future tense unless the context suggests otherwise. </li>
      <li>The default tense for Yiqtol is future tense, but when it is the first word of the clause, translate it as volitional (you shall do, he shall do, let him doâ€¦) </li>
      <li>When translating nouns, you must decide whether they are definite or indefinite. Nouns are definite when they:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>have the article (you must decide whether the article is present or not when the noun is prefixed by a preposition)</li>
        <li>are proper nouns</li>
        <li>have a pronominal suffix</li>
        <li>are in a construct chain whose last word is definite.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>A noun following a verb could be either the subject or the object of the verb. Usually, the context makes it very clear which syntactical function it plays in the clause.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
