  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Qal Yiqtol paradigms of <span class="heb" dir="rtl">קטל</span> and <span class="heb" dir="rtl">בּנה</span> must be memorized.</li>
    <li>You should be able to reproduce the paradigms in their entirety.</li>
    <li>You may download the <a href="https://github.com/martinmts/BiblicalHebrew/blob/main/Garrett_BiblicalHebrew/10_Qal%20Yiqtol%20Strong%20and%20III-Hey%20verb%20Paradigms.pdf">Qal Yiqtol Strong and III-Hey verb Paradigms Practice Sheet</a> for practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Here are some guidelines for translating Hebrew verbs:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Qatal verbs: use the past tense or present perfect tense by default (e.g., “I did,” or “I have done”).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"By default" means "without context".</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Wayyiqtol (Ch. 11) verbs: use past tense by default (e.g., “I did”).</li>
      <li>Yiqtol verbs: use future tense by default (e.g., “I will do”).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the context indicates it’s a past time activity, the yiqtol probably indicates a past time habitual action (e.g., “I used to do”).</li>
        <li>If a yiqtol verb is the first word in the sentence, translate it as volitional, such as “should do”, “would do”, “may do”, “let do”… (For more translation options of yiqtol, see pages 38–39 of the textbook, 2. Syntax and Mood.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Weqatal verbs: use future tense by default (i.e., “I will do”).</li>
      <li>(For more translation options of weqatal, see pages 64–66 of the textbook)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>On parsing:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>When you see a preposition or a pronominal suffix attached to a verb. It is almost always an infinitive construct.</li>
      <li>When you see an infinitive construct, cross out the Person, Gender, and Number boxes immediately. An infC will never have Person, Gender, and Number.</li>
      <li>The Qatal form is identical in 3mp and 3fp. We use 3cp for parsing. Do not use either 3mp or 3fp for parsing a 3cp Qatal verb; use 3cp instead. However, when you see a yiqtol verb, you should specify whether it is a 3fs/2ms or a 3fp/2fp depending on the context.</li>
      <li>The waw in weqatal and wayyiqtol verbs is part of the verbal form (conjugation). So do not put "waw" in the "Extra" box. If it is not a weqatal or a wayyiqtol verb and it has a "waw" affixed to it, you will need to put the "waw" in the "Extra" box.</li>
      <li>The Extra box in parsing question is used for anything that is not part of the verbal form, such as a preposition, an article, a pronominal suffix, and a waw (see point 4 for waw).</li>
    </ul>
