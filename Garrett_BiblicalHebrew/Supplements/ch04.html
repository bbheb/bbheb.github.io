	<h1> Ch. 4 Supplements </h1>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The first four chapters are about orthography and phonology. They are foundational to the rest of the chapters. Make sure that you learn them well. The general rules of vowel transformation (pp. 24–26) should be memorized. You may use the Hebrew words to help you understand and memorize the rules. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Others</h2>
		<p>The best way to memorize Rules 1–7 is to use the example words, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>W1. <span class="heby" dir="rtl">מֶ֫לֶךְ</span></li>
			<li>W2. <span class="heby" dir="rtl">מַלְכָּה</span></li>
			<li>W2. <span class="heby" dir="rtl">אֲדָמָה</span></li>
			<li>W1. <span class="heby" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span></li>
		</ul>
<p>How to Memorize the Rules:</p>
<ul>
	  <li>Rule 1 concerns an accented syllable. In most first year Hebrew grammar, when the accent falls on the last syllable, it is not marked. In W2–4 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">מַלְכָּה, אֲדָמָה, שׁוֹפְטִים</span>), all vowels in the accented syllable are long. In  W1 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">מֶ֫לֶךְ</span>), the accented syllable is seghol, a short vowel. Therefore, an accented syllabus is either "long" or "short", but not reduced.</li>
		<li>Rule 2 is about an open, unaccented syllable. W3 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">אֲדָמָה</span>) and W4 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span>) have open, unaccented syllables. They are either long or reduced, but never short.</li>
		<li>Rule 3 is about a closed, unaccented syllable. W1 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">מֶ֫לֶךְ</span>) and W2 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">מַלְכָּה</span>) both have it, and they are both short.</li>
		<li>Rule 4 is about the <i>general</i> rule of an open, pretonic syllable. W3 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">אֲדָמָה</span>) is an example. It has a long vowel.</li>
		<li>Rule 5 is about the <i>general</i> rule of an open, distant syllable. W3 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">אֲדָמָה</span>) is an example. It has a reduced vowel.</li>
		<li>Rule 6 is the <i>exception</i> to Rule 5. W4 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span>) is an example. The open, distant syllable in <span class="heb" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span> is unchangeable long vowel; therefore, it will not reduce.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It is the result of the contest of two rules:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Rule 4: an open, pretonic syllabus <i>generally</i> reduces.</li>
				<li>An unchangeable long vowel will not reduce! (It may be "written defectively", which is different from "reduce".)</li>
				<li>The unchangeable vowel wins!</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Rule 7 is the <i>exception</i> to Rule 4. W4 (<span class="heb" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span>) is an example. When the stint syllable will not reduce, an open, pretonic may reduce, as in <span class="heb" dir="rtl">שׁוֹפְטִים</span>.</li>
		<li>Rule 8, 9, and 10 are not related to any other rules. You should memorize them independently. You may use the example words given in the textbook as well.</li>
