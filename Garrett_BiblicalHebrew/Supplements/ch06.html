<ul>
  <li>Recognizing Qatal, Yiqtol, and Wayyiqtol.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this chapter, we are expected to memorize the conjugations of the verbs as part of the vocabulary.</li>
    <li>On page 41 of the textbook, note that Qatal and Wayyiqtol verbs are in gray boxes; Yiqtol verbs are in white.</li>
    <li>Of the three, Wayyiqtol verbs are the easiest, because they always begin with Waw.</li>
    <li>No Hebrew verbs in Biblical Hebrew begins with Waw. By the time of Biblical Hebrew, the first Waw of Hebrew verbs had been replaced by Yod. Therefore, when you see a verb beginning with Waw, you can almost be certain that it is a Wayyiqtol.</li>
    <li>We will learn Weqatal verbs later. Waqatal verbs also begin with Waw. But by that time, it shall be easy for you to recognize which is which.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Here are some guidelines for translating Hebrew verbs:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Qatal verbs: use the past tense or present perfect tense by default (e.g., “I did,” or “I have done”).</li>
		<li>2. Wayyiqtol verbs: use past tense by default (e.g., “And I did”).</li>
		<li>3. Yiqtol verbs: use future tense by default (e.g., “I will do”).</li>
    <li>4. If the context indicates it’s a past time action, the yiqtol probably indicates a past time habitual action (e.g., “I used to do”). If weqatal verb follow this yiqtol verb, they usually indicate habitual actions as well.</li>
    <li>5. If a yiqtol verb is the first word in the sentence, translate it as volitional, such as “should do”, “would do”, “may do”, “let do”…</li>
    <li>(For more translation options of yiqtol, see pages 38–39 of the textbook, 2. Syntax and Mood.)</li>
  </ul>
