  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>While other professors may require students to indicate whether a yiqtol verb is a cohortative or jussive, Dr. Garrett does not expect students to do so.</li>
    <li>You can use yiqtol for parsing.</li>
    <li>You DO need to indicate whether the verb has a paragogic Hey or it is apocopated (p. 221).</li>
    <li>Many cohortative and jussive verbs neither have a paragogic Hey or are apocopated. </li>
    <li>They look exactly like regular yiqtol verbs. </li>
    <li>The rule of thumb is that when a yiqtol verb is in the first position of a clause, it is very likely cohortative or jussive. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Your translation should be like “Let …”, “May …” etc., to bring out the volitional meaning.</li>
    </ul>
