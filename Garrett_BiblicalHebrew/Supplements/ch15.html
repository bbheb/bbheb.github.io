  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjectives have three functions:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Attributive: “the good book”</li>
      <li>Predicate: “the book is good”</li>
      <li>Substantive: “the good, the bad, and the ugly”</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If an adjective is near a noun with the same gender and number, how is the adjective used? </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Probably predicate or attributive.</li>
      <li>An attributive adjective is always after the noun that it modifies.</li>
      <li>An attributive adjective agrees with its noun with regard to definiteness.</li>
      <li>A predicate adjective never has the article.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>What if you can’t find a nearby noun that makes sense for the adjective to modify? What do the adjective’s gender and number mean then?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The adjective is substantival.</li>
      <li>The adjective is acting as a noun that has the gender and number indicated by the adjective.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Only the qal stem has both active and passive participles.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In parsings, we need to specify whether it is an active or passive participle.</li>
      <li>For other stems, we just need to indicate that it is a participle.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
