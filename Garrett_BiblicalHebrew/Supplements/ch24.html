	<h1> Ch. 24 Supplements </h1>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You will not be asked to reproduce the principal parts for the weak verbs in the derived stems, but you need to be very familiar with them (or better how weak roots behave) so that you may parse the weak verbs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Others</h2>
  <h3>Parsing the Participles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only the Qal has both active and passive participles. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In parsing, you need to indicate whether it is an active or a passive participle.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The Niphal stem has a passive or reflective meaning.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The meaning is conveyed by the Niphal stem itself. </li>
        <li>A Niphal passive participle does not exist. In parsing, you only need to say it is a Niphal participle.  </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Similarly, Pual is the passive of Piel. A Pual participle is passive in meaning, which is conveyed by the Pual stem itself.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>About Weak Verbs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong verbs are rare in the Hebrew Bible. Most verbs we encounter in the Hebrew Bible are weak verbs!</li>
    <li>Most weak verbs are not that difficult if you know how the weak roots behave. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, the gutturals will reject the dagesh forte and possibly cause the lengthening of the previous vowel;</li>
      <li>Nun with a silent shewa will assimilate;</li>
      <li>Gutturals often turn the vocal shewa into one of the Hateph vowels (also called composite Shewas). </li>
    </ul>
    <li>If you are not familiar with these, please review the first four chapters of the textbook. </li>
  </ul>
