  <h1>Instructions for installing the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard on mobile devices</h1>
  <div>If you need to type on Mac or Win, please follow the video tutorials:
    <li><a href="keyman-win.html">Install the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard on Windows</a></li>
    <li><a href="keyman-mac.html">Install the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard on MacOS</a></li>
  </div>
  <h2>Steps to install the keyboard for iOS and android devices</h2>
  <p>Note: The following instructions are for the installation of Hebrew keyboard for <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> app on iOS and android. If you need to type on Mac or Win, please follow the instructions above. Note: this keyboard has
    been submitted to Keyman. Once implemented by Keyman, users will be able to install the keyboard within the Keyman app. Before then, you may follow the steps below for installation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You need to install Keyman on a mobile device, such as an <a href="https://keyman.com/iphone-and-ipad/">iOS device</a> or an <a href="https://keyman.com/android/">android device</a>. Keyman is a free app.</li>
    <li>Then you have two options to install the keyboard.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bg-info text-white">Install the keyboard from the Kayman app ("official").</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bg-danger text-white">(only available on android. Last checked: 02/26/2021, 9:50 AM ET)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Kayman app.</li>
        <li>Click the Three dot icon at the uppoer-right corner.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>On android, you need to click "Settings".</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Click "Installed languages".</li>
        <li>Click the "+" sign.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to find "Hebrew (Ancient)".</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There are two entries with this name (android).</li>
          <li>Click the first one.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You will see two keyboards:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>SIL Hebrew</li>
          <li>hebrew_mt</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I made both. You may install both.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You may visit <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/blob/master/release/sil/sil_hebrew/source/welcome/welcome.htm">this page</a> to see the keyboard layout for "SIL Hebrew".</li>
          <li>the "hebrew_mt" keyboard has less keys. Only one layer. But it is sufficient for Dr. Garrett's Hebrew class.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <li><span class="bg-info text-white">Follow the steps below to install the custom keyboard.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This keyboard combines the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard and the "hebrew_mt" keyboard. (see below for keyboard layers). It has better viewing for the vowels and cantillations (I included the base marks).</li>
        <li>On your android device, click the download page, then download the keyboard layout file. After download, open the downloaded keyboard file in “Keyman”.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/martinmts/BiblicalHebrew/tree/main/HebrewKeyboard/sil_hebrew.kmp">the Hebrew (SIL) Keyboard download page</a> (Latest release date: 02/01/2021, 12:29 PM ET)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>On an iOS device, see note below.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Note: I have difficulty in installing the keyboard on an iPad. The only workable way I found is to install it via <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram messenger</a>:
          <ol>
            <li>Send the link of this page to your Telegram messenger.
              <ul>
                <li>you may send it to “Saved Messages” or to any other chat in Telegram.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In Telegram, click the link to view the page in Telegram.</li>
            <li>Click the link in Step 2.</li>
            <li>Click the “Download” button.</li>
            <li>Click “Open in Keyman” to start installation.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Note: on iPad/iPhone, if you want to install a new version of the keyboard, you need first to close Keyman: Double press the Home key on your iPad/iPhone and then wipe up Keyman to close it. Then follow the steps described above to install
          the keyboard. Otherwise, the new version of the keyboard will not be installed. The old version will come back.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>You need to add “Keyman” keyboard to your active keyboard list.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>On andoid, go to “System” → Languages &amp; input → On-screen keyboard → Manage on-screen keyboards. Then activate “Keyman”.</li>
      <li>On iOS, go to “Settings” → “General” → “Keyboard” → “Keyboards” → “Add New Keyboard…” to add “Keyman” to your active keyboard list.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <p>Done! You may start using it now!</p>
  <p>After installation, you may test your Hebrew typing at <a href="../HebrewTypingTest/index.html">Hebrew Typing Test</a>. <br /></p>

  <h2>Keyboard Layout for the custom keyboard</h2>
  <h4>The “Ctrl” and “Ctrl + Shift” Layers</h4>
  <p>The “Ctrl” layer contains all consonants and vowels. It is sufficient in most cases. The “Ctrl + Shift” layer marks some ambigous signs. It outputs the same results as the “Ctrl” layer.</p>
  <p>It has both Qamets and Qamets Hatuph. The 1st vowel in the 1st row is Qamets. The 5th vowel in the first row is Qamets Hatuph.</p>
  <p>Rows 2-4 follows the SIL Hebrew keyboard closely in most cases. The regular Holem is in the 2nd row, left to Peh. Type the regular Holem after Waw for “Holem Waw”. The last vowel in the 2nd row is “Holem for Waw”. It is only used when a Holem
    follows the consonantal Waw. For all other consonants, use the regular Holem.</p>

  <h4>The “Normal”, “Shift”, “ALTGR/Opt”, and “ALTGR/Opt + Shift” Layers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note: on Win, the “ALTGR” key is the “right Alt” key or “left Ctrl+ left Alt”.</li>
    <li>These layers follow the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard mapping. It is for more complicated Hebrew typing.</li>
