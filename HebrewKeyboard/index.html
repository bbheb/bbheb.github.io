  <h2 id="steps-to-install-the-keyboard-for-ios-and-android-devices">Steps to install the keyboard for iOS and android devices</h2>
  <p>Note: The following instructions are for the installation of Hebrew keyboard for <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> app on iOS and android. If you need to type on Mac or Win, please follow the instructions above. Note: this keyboard has
    been submitted to Keyman. Once implemented by Keyman, users will be able to install the keyboard within the Keyman app. Before then, you may follow the steps below for installation.</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <p>You need to install Keyman on a mobile device, such as an <a href="https://keyman.com/iphone-and-ipad/">iOS device</a> or an <a href="https://keyman.com/android/">android device</a>. Keyman is a free app.</p>

    <li>Note: I have difficulty in installing the keyboard on an iPad. The only workable way I found is to install it via <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram messenger</a>.:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Send the link of this page to your <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram messenger</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>you may send it to “Saved Messages”, or you may ask a friend to send the link to you via Telegram.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In Telegram, click the link to view the page in Telegram.</li>
        <li>Click the link in Step 2.</li>
        <li>Click the “Download” button.</li>
        <li>Click “Open in Keyman” to start installation.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Note: on iPad/iPhone, if you want to install a new version of the keyboard, you need first to close Keyman: Double press the Home key on your iPad/iPhone and then wipe up Keyman to close it. Then follow the steps described above to install
      the keyboard. Otherwise, the new version of the keyboard will not be installed. The old version will come back.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>
      <p>On your android device, open the downloaded keyboard file in “Keyman”. On an iOS device, see note above.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You need to add “Keyman” keyboard to your active keyboard list.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>On andoid, go to “System” → Languages &amp; input → On-screen keyboard → Manage on-screen keyboards. Then activate “Keyman”.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On iOS, go to “Settings” → “General” → “Keyboard” → “Keyboards” → “Add New Keyboard…” to add “Keyman” to your active keyboard list.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Done! You may start using it now!</p>
  <h1 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard Layout</h1>
  <h2 id="the-ctrl-and-ctrl-shift-layers">The “Ctrl” and “Ctrl + Shift” Layers</h2>
  <p>The “Ctrl” layer contains all consonants and vowels. It is sufficient in most cases. The “Ctrl + Shift” layer marks some ambigous signs. It outputs the same results as the “Ctrl” layer.</p>
  <p>It has both Qamets and Qamets Hatuph. The 1st vowel in the 1st row is Qamets. The 5th vowel in the first row is Qamets Hatuph.</p>
  <p>Rows 2-4 follows the SIL Hebrew keyboard closely in most cases. The regular Holem is in the 2nd row, left to Peh. Type the regular Holem after Waw for “Holem Waw”. The last vowel in the 2nd row is “Holem for Waw”. It is only used when a Holem
    follows the consonantal Waw. For all other consonants, use the regular Holem.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Note: on Win, the “ALTGR” key is the “right Alt” key or “left Ctrl+ left Alt”.</li>
    <li>These layers follow the Hebrew (SIL) keyboard mapping. It is for more complicated Hebrew typing.</li>
