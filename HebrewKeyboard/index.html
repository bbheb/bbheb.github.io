				<li>Note: If you have trouble with installation, please tell me: </li>

			<li>Why I reommend Keyman (above) over <a href="https://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx">the SBL Hebrew (SIL layout) keyboard</a>? - While both are good, I prefer Keyman for these reasons:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Keyman is still under active development, while the SBL Hebrew keyboard has not been updated since 2008.</li>
				<li>Keyman is available on Windows, MacOS, iOS, and android. But the SBL Hebrew keyboard is available on Window and MacOS only.</li>
				<li>Keyman has the same charcter encoding across all platforms, but the SBL Hebrew keyboard has different encoding for Sin and Shin between Windows and MacOS. This will cause a potential issue in online grading if online tests require Hebrew typing.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul id="note-on-keyman" class="alert alert-info">
				<li>Note:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Keyman has two versions of SIL Hebrew keyboard, one is called ❎ <span class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_hebrew">Hebrew (SIL)</span> ❎ , the other ✅ <span class="btn btn-dark">Hebrew Legacy (SIL)</span> ✅ . Please install the <span class="text text-dark">Hebrew Legacy (SIL)</span> keyboard. The <span class="text text-secondary">Hebrew (SIL)</span> keyboard will do some letter transformation depending on our typing order, which may result in unexpected outputs.</li>

					<li>Keyman is provided for us as a free software. If you enjoy using it, you may consider making a donation to SIL International (the organization behind Keyman).</li>
					<li>I appreciate their work and would like to share the information here. To donate, visit the <a href="https://donate.keyman.com/">Donation page</a> (disclaimer: I'm not affliated in anyway with the organization and do not benefit in anyway from your donation except that I can continue to use Keyman as you do).</li>

		<div id="qamets" class="alert alert-secondary">
			<ul>
				<li>Qamets Hatuph occurs much less frequently than Qamets in the Biblical Hebrew. There are about 7717
					occurrences of Qamets Hatuph in the Hebrew Bible; but there are 144303 occurrences of Qamets (18.7
					times more than Qamets Hatuph) in the
					Hebrew Bible.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Of the 7717 occurrences of Qamets Hatuph, 4347 are <span class="heb" dir="rtl">כׇּל</span>; 136
						are inflected forms of <span class="heb" dir="rtl">קֹ֫דֶשׁ</span>; about 54 are Hophal verbs.
						There are many of Qal infinitive constructs or
						imperfect/imperative verbs that have the stem vowel Holem reduced to Qamets Hatuph when a suffix
						is attached. </li>
